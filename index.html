				<h1>Summary</h1>
				<p>Welcome to my webpage!<br>My name is Marissa Le Coz, and I am a junior at Dartmouth College majoring in Computer Science. After graduating from Dartmouth in 2017, I aspire to enter an M.S. program in Computer Science with the ultimate goal of working in industry. I am currently seeking internships in software engineering/development for Summer 2016.<br><br>Upon entering college, I was sure I was going to major in Mathematics. After taking a couple of math classes and coming to the shocking realization that the major was not quite what I was looking for, I enrolled in a Computer Science class. I quickly discovered that Computer Science had all the things I loved about math (the logic; the quantitative, procedural thinking; the abstraction), while at the same time lacked the things I did not like about math (the absence of both creative opportunities and project-based work).<br><br>The fact of the matter is that, while I have always had a passion for quantitative work, I have also always had a creative side and a desire to <em>make</em> things. Computer Science allows for the perfect combination of quantitative reasoning and creative inspiration. <br><br> But all of that is only the tip of the iceberg. Most importantly, software impacts everyone's lives, and there are so many opportunities to change the world for the better through computing. I am looking forward to dedicating my professional life to projects that do just this: change the world for the better.

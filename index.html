				<h1>Summary</h1>
				<p>Welcome to my webpage!<br><br><img src="images/Marissa.jpg" id="marissa">My name is Marissa Le Coz, and I am a junior at Dartmouth College majoring in Computer Science. After graduating from Dartmouth in 2017, I aspire to enter an M.S. program in Computer Science with the ultimate goal of working in industry. I am currently seeking internships in software engineering/development for Summer 2016.<br><br>Upon entering college, I was sure I was going to major in Mathematics...but then I took my first Computer Science course. Upon taking CS 1 my freshman year, I quickly discovered that Computer Science has all the things I love about math (the logic; the quantitative, procedural thinking; the abstraction), while at the same time includes the elements I wish were part of math (project-based work, the opportunity to <em>create</em>).<br><br>The fact of the matter is that, while I have always had a passion for quantitative work, I have also always had a creative side and a desire to <em>make</em> things. Computer Science allows for the perfect combination of quantitative reasoning and creative inspiration. <br><br> But all of that is only the tip of the iceberg. Most importantly, software impacts everyone's lives, and there are so many opportunities to change the world for the better through computing. I am looking forward to dedicating my professional life to projects that do just this: change the world for the better.

This has been my first experience in UI/UX (design), which I find I also enjoy in addition to coding.

				<h1>Hobbies</h1>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Dance.</strong> I took dance classes from age 6 to age 18. While I did jazz, modern, lyrical, and ballet, my professed favorite has always been tap, which I have taken a few master classes in. I especially enjoy doing tap improv; there's something very freeing about improv. As expressed in C pseudocode:
					<div id="code">
						<p>char *marissas_brain = (char *) malloc(size(marissas_brain_capacity)); <br>
						while (there is brain capacity left) { <br>
							// work and learn <br>
						} <br>
						free(marissas_brain); // tap dances<br></p>
					</div>
					</li>
					<li><strong>Singing the praises of Computer Science.</strong> Any of my friends would attest to the fact that I'm somewhat of a Computer Science zealot. I <span class="strikethru">pressure</span> encourage my friends (and random people I meet) to try out Computer Science because of how amazing it is. I also recently (December 2015) gave a <a href="EHS_Presentation.pptx">presentation</a> to a group of STEM students from my high school on the subject of why they should consider majoring in Computer Science.</li>
					<br>
					<li><strong>Philosophy.</strong> When I need to relieve the quantitative part of my brain, I turn to Philosophy. Check out my article entitled "<a href="http://issuu.com/apologia/docs/apologia14f" target="_blank">Freedom Redefined: A Christian Perspective on the Meaning of Freedom</a>," published (on pages 25-28) in the Fall 2014 issue of <a href="http://www.dartmouthapologia.org/" target="_blank">The Dartmouth Apologia</a>, Dartmouth's journal of Christian thought.</li>
